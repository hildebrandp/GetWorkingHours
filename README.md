# Get Working Hours

## Installation
The application can be installed like any other normal application. It automatically adds itself to the autostart.

## Usage
The application starts along with the computer and records the time it was started. Based on this time, the tool calculates the actual working time.

The working time can be viewed in two ways. Firstly, by hovering the mouse pointer over the icon in the Windows taskbar, or secondly, by right-clicking on the icon and selecting 'Restore'. This opens a window where you can see the worked time and the currently deducted break time at the bottom.

In this window, you can manually enter your start time, which will be saved until the next start. Additionally, you can enter how long you have taken or plan to take a break. The minimum break time is 45 minutes, but you can completely disable the deduction of break time using the 'Checkbox'.

The window can be closed by clicking the 'X', but the software continues to run in the background.

When 9 working hours are reached, a notification is displayed indicating that you have been working for more than 9 hours. Another notification is displayed when you reach 9 hours and 45 minutes, reminding you that you should start wrapping up as there is a violation of working time regulations after 10 hours. If you exceed 10 hours, a final message is displayed...

## Calculation of Break Time
The first break of 15 minutes is deducted after 2 hours of work. The remaining 30 minutes are deducted after a total working time of 6 hours.
